So, starting with some vague memories of HTML/CSS and even vaguer of JS, I started messing around on a localhost.", "Quite quickly I realised pure HTML and CSS would make designing anything more than one or two pages a real hassle, so I figured I’d try make a simple JS script that could generate the HTML I needed on each render. It wasn’t long before I realised there might already be a solution (at this point I knew almost nothing about frontend/webdev), and I quickly found React.js."]
